Question 1:
Are Properties more or less specific than the special attribute methods? Explain your answer. 

Your Answer:
Properties are more specific than special attribute methods.
Properties allow computations to accesses involving a specific attribute, 
so we can easily extend a subclass with different behavior on that attribute 
without rewriting the __getattr__() method.

_

    self._time = value

Your Answer:
@time.setter

Question 4:
What is the decorator for turning the time() method into a property getter--what replaces the ??? below?

def time(self):
