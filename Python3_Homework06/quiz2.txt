Python 3: The Python Environment
Lesson 6, Quiz 2

Question 1:
How would you write a compiled regular expression to find the name "John Smith" in case-insensitive format?

Your Answer:
re.compile(r"John Smith", re.IGNORECASE)

Question 2:
How would you rewrite the compiled regular expression above to include verbose comments?

Your Answer:
re.compile(r"John Smith", re.IGNORECASE | re.VERBOSE)
Mentor Comments:
This isn't working to find "John Smith", yet it's finding "JohnSmith".  How might this be fixed?

>>> m = re.search(regex, "One of the great railroad tycoons, JohnSmith, move to Montana in the 1800s.")
>>> m
<_sre.SRE_Match object at 0x13006b0>
>>> m.group()
'JohnSmith'

Overall Comments:
Q2 needs more testing.  Ignoring whitespace has consequences for having them in the pattern.
