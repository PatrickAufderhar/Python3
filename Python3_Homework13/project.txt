Python 3: The Python Environment
Lesson 13, Project 1

Here are your instructions:
Create a Python3_Homework13 project and assign it to your Python3_Homework working set. 
In the Python3_Homework13/src folder, create a program named mathquiz.py. In this program, you will create a math quiz. 
This quiz will ask the user five addition questions adding random integers between 1 and 10 inclusive. 
Each answer will be timed so you can generate the following time results:

+ Time for each question 
+ Total time for all questions 
+ Average time per question

This program needs to generate random numbers using Python's random library. 
You may find the following code snippet useful:

>>> import random
>>> random.randrange(1, 10)
4
>>> random.randrange(1, 10)
3

Your project should meet the following conditions:
+ You must include a working test_mathquiz.py unittest file that tests at least one function. 
+ Each time the test runs, it must present random integers.

Your code must generate output that looks like this:

What is the sum of 6 and 6? 12
12 is right!
What is the sum of 5 and 4? 9
9 is right!
What is the sum of 4 and 2? 6
6 is right!
What is the sum of 1 and 1? 2
2 is right!
What is the sum of 9 and 2? 111
111 is wrong!
Question #1 took about 1 seconds to complete and was right.
Question #2 took about 1 seconds to complete and was right.
Question #3 took about 1 seconds to complete and was right.
Question #4 took about 2 seconds to complete and was right.
Question #5 took about 2 seconds to complete and was wrong.
You took 9 seconds to finish the quiz
Your average time was 1.8 seconds per question

Submit mathquiz.py and test_mathquiz.py when your programs are working to your satisfaction.
