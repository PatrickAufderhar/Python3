Python 3: The Python Environment
Lesson 9, Quiz 1

Question 1:
What is the alternative name for special methods?

Your Answer:
magic methods
Mentor Comments:
none

Question 2:
Which special method is called by the print() built-in?


Your Answer:
__str__()
Mentor Comments:
none

Question 3:
Trick question! If __setattr__ sets attributes and __delattr__ deletes attributes, what method gets attributes?


Your Answer:
__getattribute__
Mentor Comments:
I'll accept that.  val = obj.attr triggers __getattribute__ (as distinct from __getattr__) 
which automates the hunt along the MRO in all relevant __dict__s for a resolving 
key / name.  Failing that, __getattr__ is fired (if present) as a last resort.
Overall Comments:
Excellent.  See comments.
