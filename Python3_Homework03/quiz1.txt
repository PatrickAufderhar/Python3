Python 3: The Python Environment
Lesson 3, Quiz 1

Question 1:
What is the difference between an iterator and an iterable?

Your Answer:
An iterable is something we can iterate over, while an iterator is what the interpreter uses to do the iteration.


Mentor Comments:
iterators are guaranteed to have __iter__ and __next__ methods.
Question 2:
What is a generator function and what is its advantage?

Your Answer:
A generator function is a function which returns an iterator. 
A generator allows us to create sequence values one at a time, so there is no need to store all of them. Hence the program will uses less storage and operate more quickly, especially when the number of objects becomes large.
