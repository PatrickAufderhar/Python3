Question 2:
What is the difference between list comprehension and a generator expression?

Your Answer:
When the generated result needs to be stored and iterated over multiple times, a list comprehensions is preferred since a generator expression only iterates once.
When the data range is large or infinite, a generator expression is more suitable since it creates items on the fly and uses less memory, while a list comprehension will create the entire list in the memory and thus inefficient.
